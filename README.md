### What I learned

🔴 Issue 3 Image alignment hack
.tck-category-img img {
  margin-left: auto;
}


This works, but it’s fragile.

Better:

.tck-category-img {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

🔴 Event Propogation -> event target -> event current target

🔴 event.target.dataset ---> is object of {} all data attribute of current dom.


🔴Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module (at index.js:1:1)

🔴eclipse Image was resizing on screen changes
